Some of the features of Cayenne include:

* A GUI (Cayenne Modeler) for mapping database tables and columns to Java
  classes and attributes, mapping relationships, generating Java classes,
  defining callback and listener life cycle events, configuring caching
  options, configuring database connection pools, reverse engineering
  databases, database schema generation, defining shared queries, and mapping
  stored procedures.

* Transactional management features (such as rollback, undo, commit) using
  Cayenne's control layer (the "context" -- described later) or optionally
  deferring to the container (such as JBoss) if in a J2EE environment.
